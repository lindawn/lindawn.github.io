I'm Dawn, a dedicated *Edge Computing Software Engineer* at **Dell EMC** based in Singapore. Previously, I worked in numerous tech startups in various stages of development, which have allowed me to thrive in dynamic and innovative environments, building upon the strong foundation in computing concepts from my time at the National University of Singapore (NUS).

At this point in my career, I am particularly interested in Operating Systems, as I simply think that they are neat :)

## Certifications and Projects

During my down time, I like to work on projects to keep up with tech skills, and pursue certifications.

I am a **Certified Kubernetes Application Developer (CKAD)**, and due for my **Linux Foundation Certified System Administrator (LFCS)** test soon. 

My current side project is a *Telegram bot* running on a *Raspi Zero* that I use to track my progress at the gym! The data is stored locally in MongoDB, and I am working on designing a suitable visualisation board on Grafana.
