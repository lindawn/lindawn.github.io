Hello, I'm Dawn, a dedicated *Edge Computing Software Engineer* at **Dell EMC** based in Singapore. My professional growth has been enriched through diverse experiences, including contributions to tech startups in various stages of development. These experiences have honed my skills and allowed me to thrive in dynamic and innovative environments, building upon the strong foundation in computing concepts from my time at the National University of Singapore (NUS).

At this point in my career, I am particularly interested in strengthening my concepts and skill set in Linux Operating Systems, as I simply think that they are neat :)

## Certifications and Projects

During my down time, I like to work on my side projects, or hone my skills related to work, and get certified.

I am a **Certified Kubernetes Application Developer (CKAD)**, and due for my **Linux Foundation Certified System Administrator (LFCS)** test soon. 

My current side project is a *Telegram bot* running on a *Raspi Zero* that I use to track my progress at the gym! The data is stored locally in MongoDB, and I am working on designing a suitable visualisation board on Grafana.
